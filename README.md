# Grad_Math_Project-1
A repo  containing all the files for Grad Math project-1
This project is about modeling the relationship between COVID-19 infection rates of counties in PA with the political orientation of the population and their education level.
y -> COVID-19 infection rate of each county
x1 -> political orientation of each county
x2 -> education level of each county

first set of hurdles- 
1. There is no such thing as the political orientation of a county
2. there is no such thing as the education level of a county
3. All the data sets are heavily swayed by the population of that county

Plan to overcome these-
1. Political orientation of a county can be defined as a f(#republican,#democrat,#other,population)
2. Education level of a county can be defined as a function of all the discreet levels of education
3. All the data sets used is to be normalised by the population of each county.
